# Window Fill

Manage windows on a large resolution monitor more easily (for Windows OS only). This utility allows you to maximise a window to fill an empty portion of the desktop using a global keyboard shortcut. You can use this to tile multiple windows in complex ways.

The default hotkey is `CTRL-SHIFT-Q`.

## Download

* Download [Distribute/Window Fill.zip]().
* Extract it wherever you want and use `Window Fill.exe` to run the program.
* Recommended: add `Window Fill.exe` to Windows start-up by... (TODO).

You can also [download]() an (older) version that has a notification area GUI instead of a console window.


## Build

Use `create_distributable.py` to turn `run_with_console.py` into a distributable in the folder `build/<xxx>/`.
